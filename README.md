# ARPlay
Simple AR app for android to detect a 2D image (with it's position, rotation and distance) and place a 3D model on it (in this case a 3D knight figure). Created using unity. # Working only for android smartphones which support Google ARcore. 

Here I used King of Spades as the 2D image to detect. (can add as many images as you want)
After detecting the image it will thrack the position, rotation and distance to place the 3D object (I used a knight in the Assets folder)
